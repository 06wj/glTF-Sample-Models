Each sample model is provided in the following formats:
* glTF (.gltf) with separate resources: .bin (geometry, animation, skins), .glsl (shaders), and image files
* glTF (.gltf) with embedded resources
* Binary glTF (.blg) using the [KHR_binary_glTF](../extensions/Khronos/KHR_binary_glTF/README.md) extension
* Original COLLADA (.dae)

Some models have usage restrictions.  See the `README.txt` in the model's directory if present.
